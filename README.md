# Digital-Dice
Project Overview:
This project is an electronic dice built using an Arduino, a 7-segment display, and a push button. When the button is pressed, the display simulates the rolling of a die and then stops at a random number between 1 and 6. A buzzer also provides an audible cue for a better user experience.
